### Biodiversity metrics

Instructor: Thore 

#### Today we will...

- get the data from google sheets 
- calculate measurements of biodiversity
- plot them against elevation
- produce a data frame that can be used for the modelling tomorrow
- continue to populate the data base


To connect to the google sheet please install the R package "googlesheets4". Furthermore, we need "tidyverse", "vegan" and "mobr" but you probably already have them installed.

As you continue to add studies to the data base, you should rerun the script from today so you always work with the most up-to-date version.
