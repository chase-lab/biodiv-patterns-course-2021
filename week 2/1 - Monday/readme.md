## Morning session: Biodiversity gradients (lecture/discussion) 
Instructor: Jon

## Afternoon session: Diversity gradients (computer lab)
Instructor: Thore Engel ("Tory")
Email: thore.engel\@idiv.de 


#### During this session you will...
- become familiar with basic theories explaining the latitudinal diversity gradient 
- develop scenarios of how changes in the "components" of biodiversity can result into observed diversity gradients
- quantify latitudinal diversity gradients using the measurement of biodiversity framework
- compare diversity patterns between different groups of organism (trees and reef fish)

Code and data will be provided in this folder.
